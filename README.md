# 🚀 My DevOps Journey

This repository tracks my transition into DevOps engineering. Each week covers a new pillar of the field, moving from manual operations to automated infrastructure.

## 🏁 Week 1: Linux & Networking Foundations
- **File System Mastery**: Navigating complex directory trees and managing permissions (`chmod`/`chown`).
- **Process Management**: Monitoring system health with `htop` and controlling background tasks.
- **Networking**: Investigating HTTP headers with `curl`, testing connectivity with `ping`, and analyzing open ports.
- **Security**: Understanding the `sudo` privilege model and securing sensitive files.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
- **VCS**: Git & GitHub
- **Tools**: curl, wget, ss, htop, vim
