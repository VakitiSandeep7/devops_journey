# 📂 Week 2: Bash Scripting & Automation

In Week 2, I am moving from manual operations to building automated tools.

## 🚀 Day 8: Foundations of Scripting
Today I built my first interactive automation tool.

### Key Learnings:
- **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`):** Ensuring the script runs in the correct environment.
- **Permissions:** Using `chmod +x` to grant execution rights.
- **Variables & Input:** Using `read` to make scripts interactive and `$VARIABLE` to reuse data.
- **Command Substitution:** Using `$(date)` to pull live system data into the script.

### Script Showcase: `sys_report.sh`
This script automates system health checks, including uptime monitoring and disk space analysis.
